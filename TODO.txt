brute force
    - make sure all input variables are in the attack_option
    - make starting point algorithm to have different stasrting points in the charset
    - recursive brute force 

start with recursive brute force
    - try and kill the thread when found 
    - if not try to implement itterative approach 

start unit testing instead to show testing better

implement hash detector


- need to test dictionary attack    

#Needs to be polished
\- allow user to load previous attack

#installewd cuda on anaconda
need to experiment with it
